# SimCrackGAN
Synthesizing Semantic Crack Images Using Propagation Simulations and GANs

## 💾 Dataset

The comprehensive dataset used in this study consists of **90,000 images** and is available for download. The dataset is organized into two main parts:

1.  **Real-World / Ground Truth CFD Dataset (20,000 images):**
    * This is a collection of **10,000 real-world crack images** and **10,000 ground truth images:**
    * These images serve a dual role: they act as the **ground truth** for the GAN's training and generation process, and also as the dataset for **comparison and evaluation** of the model's performance.

2.  **GAN-Generated Data (70,000 images):**
    * **10,000 image ground truth** generated by our primary GAN model.
    * **30,000 images** generated by the GAN with added noise.
    * **30,000 images** generated by the noise-free GAN.
